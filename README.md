# Product List Mobile Test App

This is a mobile application built using **Expo** to display available products and handle user authentication using the **Fake Store API**. The app demonstrates the implementation of a login screen, displaying products with proper routing, and handling API requests with authorization.

## Features

- **Login Screen**: Users can sign in using a login/password interface.
- **Product List Screen**: Displays all available products fetched from the API.
- **Single Product Screen**: Shows detailed information about a specific product.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling for network issues, missing products, and failed login attempts.
- **Smooth Animations**: The app features smooth transitions and animations for a better user experience.
- **Routing**: Proper navigation and routing between screens using React Navigation.

This app interacts with the Fake Store API for product data and authentication.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
